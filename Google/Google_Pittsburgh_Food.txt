We barely finished our pretzels and our dinner was served. However... the food and the noise levels were horrible. I had to yell across the table to talk to my date and finally gave up trying to have a conversation. I couldn&#39;t even hear the waitress. There&#39;s no reason the band had to be that loud especially on a wednesday night. I was not happy with the Polish Hill dish. The sauerkraut wasn&#39;t good, the perogies were tasteless and the kielbasa was okay. Overall I feel cheated for a birthday dinner and it was not worth the price of the plate. Never going back.";

My friends and I got the nachos, spring rolls, and goat cheese sandwich. The nachos were cheesy and was a good proportion. The spring rolls sounded real good from my friend, and my sandwich was mm mmm tasty. I would definately come again and recommend to all.";

But, I think tonight is the last night I will be going. About ten minutes after the four of us bought our drinks the music suddenly became obnoxiously loud and the lights were turned off. Not turned down, off. We asked for the light above our table to be turned back on, but we were firmly told no, that they were &quot;setting a mood&quot; to sell their shot specials. At least five other tables cleared out almost immediately. A few were replaced by girls buying cheap shots in dixie cups. It was rather pathetic to be surrounded by tarted up girls buying their own bottom shelf shots. I thought I&#39;d never say this. But, next time I&#39;m in the Southside I&#39;m going to Starbucks. Even during the day the Beehive has lost my business. Its become just another cheap and trashy bar in the Southside serving cheap drinks in plastic cups";

They have a unique menu that covers just about every seafood dish you can think of. The food was good. I had some really good mako shark, never seen that on a menu. The decor looks like it hasn&#39;t been updated since the 80&#39;s. Kind of hokey. But the view is amazing. Great of the city. When you leave, make sure and walk across the street and check out the scene over the ledge. Really awesome. All that being said, the service was really pretty crappy. My dad and I ordered a bottle of wine, appetizer, 2 entrees and sides. Had a GREAT meal, at towards the end, I gave the waiter a number to call a cab driver. Pretty straight forward. She looks at the card like it&#39;s made of poison. Saying &quot;oh...we can&#39;t call a cab until you&#39;ve paid your tab.&quot; We hand her the card and say &quot;we&#39;re done&quot;. She goes away and comes back about 5 minutes later and says &quot;would you prefer I call a cab driver we use a lot? he can be here in about 5 minutes.&quot; We said &quot;I don&#39;t understand why you can&#39;t just call the driver we asked.&quot; and she makes a big deal out of it. We tell her not to worry about it and to just bring us the check. We call the cab and have to wait about 20 minutes out in the 32 degree pittsburgh night to wait for a cab. Really a bad close to a good night. But poor service regardless. I don&#39;t know if they just want to get business for &quot;their&quot; cabby or what, but they showed us that they care more about a cab driver than they do their own paying customers. We spent $220 and wound up feeling like crap. The food was good, but we won&#39;t be going back. I suggest you pass on this place.";

Many other folks seem to be big fans of this location, and my friend I went with really enjoyed her fish tacos (they were delicious, I won&#39;t deny that). I only ate here once, so the sample size is practically invalid, but I&#39;m going to have to stick by my three-star experience. I thought the atmosphere was extremely tacky and especially out-of-place in the Strip District. For Pete&#39;s sake, it&#39;s Caribbean themed. The fake grass, the waitstaff in Hawaiian shirts, the tiki bar - it was a bit too close to Red Lobster for my comfort. I ordered the paella, which was maybe my mistake. Way too salty, first off, and the delicate flavors that are supposed to be in a paella weren&#39;t there. If I could get over the immature hilarity of ordering a fish taco, I may have had a better experience despite the decor. All I know is the paella though. Take this review with a grain of salt, but please, don&#39;t add it to the paella.";
