He explained to us how the nurses have been very ruff when grabbing his hand to inject a needle. Also, grabbing him in a ruff manor to suddenly flip him over to check his surgical bandages. This poor man has been suffering a long time from a spinal injury acquired while at work. He just had another surgery 2 days ago. A drainage tube had to be removed from his spine this morning. He said, the nurse was unnecessarily ruff and treated him rudely. She called him names trying to make him feel ashamed because he cried out in pain! The poor man has had 2 vertibrae scraped and fused together, plus, 2 holes drilled into his spinal bones to allow the nerves going into his legs to function better. These type of nurses need to be fired! At least have these nurses reprimanded and put on leave for a period of time, ordering them to seek psychological treatment. Obviously, they have never experienced severe pain.";

When I got to the back to receive treatment, after seven hours of waiting, there were no hospital beds, so they had me sit in a chair, in a room with blood on the floor. Someone who is sick enough to be put on morphine warrants a hospital bed, you would think. Turns out the mal-educated woman who was supposed to be taking down my insurance information never did; I found this out when I got a collections call, instead of ever receving a bill from the hospital.

My Mom passed away almost two years ago from an illness and we had to travel from Erie to Magee Women&#39;s hospital for the the last two weeks of her life. Their staff in the ICU was just amazing. They gave her immediate attention and care and made sure she was comfy while they were trying to figure out what was wrong. They assisted her in every way possible and all of the staff was so great to her. For a brief period she was transferred into a regular room and they too were great. They would heat up her soup at night for her and everyone there let us come and go to visit her as we wanted. The one night we could not find a hotel so they gave us blankets and pillows for the waiting room and made us feel welcome. When my Mom took a turn for the worse her Dr. promised me that he would call me personally in the morning to tell me to come down right away. Unfortunately she did get worse but her Dr. kept his promise and because of him we were able to make it down there from Erie before she passed away. They were so patient and wonderful while explaining to us what was going on. When it was time for her to leave us they let all of us kids in there to be with her during her final moments. And after that they set out refreshments and stuff to snack on since we had been there all day long and were exhausted. They truly made a bad experience much better because of how good they were to her and to us. I&#39;ll never forget that and I hope they all stay so caring and compassionate throughout their careers.";

When I called Magee as to why they never sent me a bill, they apologized and acknowledged that they must NOT have contacted the collection agency. Accidently, once Magee sent me an itemized bill and I noticed that my insurance was not billed for one of the services. Since then, I always requested for itemized bills for my maternity services but never received them. I called three times at 1 month interval and had an extensive discussion but still I never received itemized bills. Though my insurance pays 80% of the costs, I still pay the remaining 20% and so I have a right to know what I am paying for. Every time I went for my pregnancy ultrasound, I received a statement with very different balances. I cannot understand why they do not send me an itemized bill. I have no idea what I am paying for. PLEASE ask for itemized bills and check the charges. And by the way, if you did not know- UPMC is supposedly a non-profit organization!!";
